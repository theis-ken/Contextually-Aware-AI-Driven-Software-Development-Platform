Extend the existing Java classes by adding JSON-based file persistence using Gson. 
Add methods to save all data (transactions, categories, and spending limits) to a file, and to load them back on startup. 
We will continue to evolve the application with further prompts, so make the annotation style consistent and clear for future reference.
