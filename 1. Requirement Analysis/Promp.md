Based on the description, generate user stories, acceptance criteria, and formal requirements:

We create a personal finance tracker. The user (me) wants to record a new transaction. They should be able to enter a description, the amount of money involved, the date it happened, and whether its an expense or an income. The user can also assign a category (e.g. "Groceries" or "Salary"). 

The user wants to see a summary of their finances for a selected month. It should include how much they earned, how much they spent, and how much money is left. They also want to be able to see a breakdown by category.

The user can create custom categories for expenses or income. For example, they might create a category called "books" or "freelance". The user should also be able to rename or delete categories.

The user wants to filter their transactions. They should be able to view only transactions from a specific date range or form a specific category. This helps them analyze their spending patterns. 

The user can set a monthly spending limit for a category. If their expenses in that category get close to the limit, they get a warning. This helps them control their budget.

Lastly, The user wants to always see their current balance: total income minus total expenses. 
This balance should update automatically when new transactions are added or removed.
